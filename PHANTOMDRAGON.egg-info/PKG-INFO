# GRADE

This reposatory includes all scripts nececarry to calculate the GRAil-based DEscriptor (GRADE) and the eXtended GRAil-based DEscriptor (X-GRADE) and the scripts that are nececarry to reproduce the results of the paper "GRADE and X-GRADE: Unveiling novel Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprints based on GRAIL-Scores"

## Install

To reproduce the results of the paper, one has to install a package called PHANTOMDRAGON 
(PHarmacophore bAsed scoriNg funcTiOn iMplementations using DRug interAction Grail scOre calculatioNs). For your convinience, the package is available right here in this repository. To install the package, only one step is required:

``pip install .``

Of course one has to be in the GRADE directory for this to work. This should also install all dependencies that you need.

## GRADE/X-GRADE generation

Depending on your data structure, run one of the following commands to generate GRADE or X-GRADE:

``calc_descr_pdb_bind.py [-h] -d COMPLEX_DATA_DIR -o OUT_CSV_FILE [-c] [-x]``

Calculates GRADE/X-GRADE for a set of input ligand-protein complexes. The Files have to be organized in PDBbind manner.
